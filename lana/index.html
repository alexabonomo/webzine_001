        You're invited to the No. 1 party of the year. A peek into Lana's IP!!!!!!
        <br />
        <br />
        As you know by now, humanity as we knew it has made the trek (ushered by the metaverse and all that blah blah
        blah) into the ~online~ sphere.
        <br />
        <br />
        Parties themselves have changed, but we've still got the best lineups, crowds and venues of any party back in
        the 21st Century.
