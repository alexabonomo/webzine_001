           <p> 
            1. Preheat oven to desired temperament <br>
            2. In a large bowl, combine The Sky and The Earth. <br>
            Mix in closed eyes to scorching Sun and the faces of the Moon.<br>
            Clean and oil hands with The Stars, then knead for 5 minutes to form a smooth storm.<br>
            
            <b>It will still be a little wet.</b><br>
            
            3. Divide the storm into 4 parts, with the intention of giving each the same status, rights and opportunities (they won’t).<br>
            Roll each piece into a ball. <br>
            One will rise <br>
            One will splinter <br>
            One will promise relief <br>
            One will threaten to blow everything away <br>
            
            You keep them all <br>

            4. Bake in preheated oven until they come together and the Earth becomes Fragrant. (about 15 minutes) <br>
            5. Let her cool down. Once she does, place her back to toast until she screams, “I’M DONE.” <br>
            6. Serve day-of. When breaking, make sure we can imagine something different, <br>
            <br>
            Warning: this is a flawed recipe. It is messy, but hearty.
