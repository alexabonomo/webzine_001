HOW TO BAKE AND BREAK BREAD
INSTRUCTIONS inspired by Zarina’s “Home is a Foreign Place”
1. Preheat oven to desired temperament
2. In a large bowl, combine The Sky and The Earth.
Mix in closed eyes to scorching Sun and the faces of the Moon.
Clean and oil hands with The Stars, then knead for 5 minutes to form a smooth storm.

It will still be a little wet.

3. Divide the storm into 4 parts, with the intention of giving each the same status, rights and opportunities (they won’t).
Roll each piece into a ball.
One will rise
One will splinter
One will promise relief
One will threaten to blow everything away

You keep them all

4. Bake in preheated oven until they come together and the Earth becomes Fragrant. (about 15 minutes)
5. Let her cool down. Once she does, place her back to toast until she screams, “I’M DONE.”
6. Serve day-of. When breaking, make sure we can imagine something different,
Warning: this is a flawed recipe. It is messy, but hearty.
