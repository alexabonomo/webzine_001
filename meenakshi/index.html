    <div id="myDIV">you traverse down a dirt road, suddenly a scent wafts your way and engulfs you, entangles you in ribbons. is that your favorite most nostalgic childhood meal? or maybe it's a comforting snack on a tough day. like a cartoon character, you are lifted and carried to the source of the scent
      <br>listen up now, and you'll hear a cheerful voice calling to you...</br></div>

     <p>
       you are sitting in the most comfortable chair smelling your most favorite scents. mine are sandalwood and fresh linen.
     </p>
  <p>
    what's your favorite scent?
  </p>
  <p>
    what was that?
  </p>
  you look like you hurt your head pretty bad there...
  <br>
  what? capitalism? societal collapse? climate disaster? broken mcflurry machines? what're you talking about, bestie?
     <p>
       there are no rules here. nature has taken over. the earth is at balance. come rest your head on the mossy grass, dinner will be ready soon.

     <em>you rest your head, the crook in your neck is gone and your posture is suddenly perfect. your skin has cleared. your jaw is unclenched. you have not a worry in the world. you begin hearing soft voices, tinkering of utensils near you.</em>
     <p>
       "i have an onion" "i have carrots" "i have cumin" "i have cutlery"
     </p>
     <p>
       <em>but wait, you say. i don't have anything</em>
     </p>
     <p>
       you have a tummy, a mouth, a seat at the table. you have just enough.
